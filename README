"A wicked fast source browser"

OpenGrok is a fast and usable source code search and cross reference engine.
It helps you search, cross-reference and navigate your source tree. It can
understand various program file formats and version control histories like
Mercurial, Git, SCCS, RCS, CVS, Subversion, Teamware, ClearCase, Perforce,
Monotone and Bazaar. In other words it lets you grok (profoundly understand)
source code and is developed in the open, hence the name OpenGrok. It is
written in Java.

To deploy:

    juju bootstrap
    juju deploy opengrok
    juju expose opengrok

Then do a `juju status` to determine the IP of the service, and open
http://IPADDRESS:8080/source

The opengrok charm uses a standalone tomcat6 instance and is very space,
I/O, and CPU intensive. It is not recommended to co-op this service with
an existing servlet engine unless you really know what you're doing.

To configure:
    XXX update with JSON format, aliases are required!
    juju set opengrok og_content=lp:juju

Only lp repos are supported at this time. You can add as many repos as
you wish though you're currently limited to adding them one at a time.
The indexer will automatically kick off to update the project and database.

To check on the status of the indexer

    juju ssh opengrok/INSTANCE_ID initctl status opengrok-index
    
    opengrok-index start/running, process 10090

XXX note concerning synchronous indexing

A daily cronjob is installed to update the indexes.

Known Issues:

 * A bug was discovered with the history index building and has been disabled
   in the meanwhile by this charm. Tracked upstream by:

    http://defect.opensolaris.org/bz/show_bug.cgi?id=19245

    NOTE: a dedicated opensolaris login is required to update bugs. OpenID is
          unsupported.

 * Updating existing sandboxes: currently this is a manual affair, eventually a
   cron job will exist that will walk sandboxes, pull them and kickoff an update
