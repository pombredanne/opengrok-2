"A wicked fast source browser"

OpenGrok is a fast and usable source code search and cross reference engine.
It helps you search, cross-reference and navigate your source tree. It can
understand various program file formats and version control histories like
Mercurial, Git, SCCS, RCS, CVS, Subversion, Teamware, ClearCase, Perforce,
Monotone and Bazaar. In other words it lets you grok (profoundly understand)
source code and is developed in the open, hence the name OpenGrok. It is
written in Java.

To deploy:

    juju bootstrap
    juju deploy opengrok
    juju expose opengrok

Then do a `juju status` to determine the IP of the service, and open
http://IPADDRESS:8080/source

The opengrok charm uses a standalone tomcat6 instance and is very space,
I/O, and CPU intensive. It is not recommended to co-op this service with
an existing servlet engine unless you really know what you're doing.

Currently opengrok is setup as a single project. Source code to be indexed
should be pushed /var/opengrok/src and then update the index by:

    cd /opt/opengrok/bin && ./OpenGrok update

This takes a while and should probably be setup as a nighly cron job

By default a branch of the latest juju source is downloaded and indexed
for demonstration purposes.

Known Issues:

A bug was discovered with the history index building and has been disabled
in the meanwhile by this charm. Tracked upstream by:
