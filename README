"A wicked fast source browser"

OpenGrok is a fast and usable source code search and cross reference engine.
It helps you search, cross-reference and navigate your source tree. It can
understand various program file formats and version control histories like
Mercurial, Git, SCCS, RCS, CVS, Subversion, Teamware, ClearCase, Perforce,
Monotone and Bazaar. In other words it lets you grok (profoundly understand)
source code and is developed in the open, hence the name OpenGrok. It is
written in Java.

To deploy:

	juju bootstrap
    juju deploy opengrok
    juju expose opengrok

Then do a `juju status` to determine the IP of the service, and open
http://IPADDRESS:8080/source

The opengrok charm uses a standalone tomcat6 instance and is very space,
I/O, and CPU intensive. It is not co-op this service with an existing
servlet engine at this time.
